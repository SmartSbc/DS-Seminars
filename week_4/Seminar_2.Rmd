Loading the `credit.csv` from Introduction to Statistical Learning Resources and all the other required libraries.

```{r loading data set and library}
library(glmnet)
library(tidyverse)

data <- read_csv("./Credit.csv")
```

Now we will use the `%>%` operator to create a pipeline to reformat all the variables to the correct datatypes

```{r re-formatting the data}
library(dplyr)
data -> data %>%
  mutate(Own = as.factor(Own), 
         Student = as.factor(Student), 
         Married = as.factor(Married), 
         Region = as.factor(Region))
```
